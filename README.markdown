#Portfolio

This is an assignment to introduce one of the core practices in design: exploring the existing
design space, critically examining examples, and taking whatâ€™s good and making something
better or new.

To get you started your goal here is to explore the design space of portfolios, in particular web
portfolios, as preparation for your first web assignment which is to build your own portfolio. 

You need to:

###Read the following
[Personality in Design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/personality-in-design/)
[Steal Like and Artist](http://www.austinkleon.com/2011/03/30/how-to-steal-like-an-artist-and-9-other-things-nobody-told-me/)
[Minimum Viable Personality](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/09/minimum-viable-personality.html)
###Find 10 Portfolios that are based on at least 5 of the 10 generic layouts identified [here](http://designshack.net/articles/layouts/10-rock-solid-website-layout-examples) and which span the portfolio design space in an interesting way.
###For each site you need to create a table in which you characterize key portfolio
attributes such as

* Brand: [Make a persona using these guidelines](http://aarronwalter.com/design-personas/)

###This is your first opportunity to familiarize yourself with our method for handing in
assignments. Information is to be found blah blah
If you have trouble now is the time to ask the TAs.
